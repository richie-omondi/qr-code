## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Bootstrap 5
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to use Bootstrap to quickly come up with a card that I can use to add the QR code image and then begin styling it using different classes. I also learned how to implement semantic HTML5 to improve code readabilty and accessibility.

### Continued development

I want to work on bringing my implementations closer to the designs given.

### Useful resources

- [Bootstrap 5 docs](https://getbootstrap.com/)
